# Google Photos Sync
I've started using Google Photos, it works incredibly well but I've got two problems I want to solve.

1. **I want to retrain a local copy of my data**: I know I can download files through the web browser but I've got way too many pictures to download over a dodgy Australian internet connection in anything less than about 5 days, also I want to be able to run some sort of sync command rather than need to manually copy files around.

2. **I want to upload a lot of files**: Sure I can upload things through the web browser but there is no Linux client and my internet connection is way too slow and flaky.

So I though "Hey, it looks like Google Photos has a [REST API](https://developers.google.com/photos/library/guides/overview), why not make a sync tool and keep all my photos in both NextCloud and Google Photos."

**Most Likely**: I am very busy and I will never finish this.  
**Possibly**: I will make a sync tool that's stable enough for me and could be used by others with a little hacking on the code.  
**Incredibly Unlikely**: This will become a user friendly tool which others can use to sync their Google Photos. (If that happens I'll update the readme.)
